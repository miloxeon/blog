I'm busy launching [my own blog](https://miloslav.website/blog/), so I'll make this quick.

Not long ago, I wrote about [how I left dev.to]({% post_url 2021-07-07-leaving-devto %}) because they shadowbanned my essay. Long story short, Hashnode **also shadowbanned** this very essay ‚Äî [here it is]({% post_url 2021-06-17-pixelhunter %}).

So, everything I said about dev.to is true for Hashnode as well.

That's the reason number one.

The reason number two is when I tried to engage with the community and other people's discussions, I saw a lot of posts and views, but close to no **replies**. That means the majority of Hashnode users are here not for discussing what they find interesting and not for collaboration, but for the sake of **being on Hashnode**.

They try to _grow their online presence_ by crossposting generic takes on age-old topics all over the developers' publishing scene.

I don't want to be a part of this. To me, thousands of my dev.to followers mean nothing, because dev.to subscribe them to me automatically. They never **wanted** to subscribe.

To me, one **genuine** follower who wants to read my essays not because they (not) feature some trendy tech and hashtags, but because they're **my** essays, worth more than a thousand regular "followers" on dev.to or Hashnode.

I also dislike the Hashnode's handling of my essays. You got to either explicitly ban them with notifying me, or don't ban them at all. What kind of censorship is this?
