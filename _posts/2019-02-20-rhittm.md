tldr: It shows you when to post on Instagram and what hashtags to use to get more views.

Hello! Today I launch Rhittm – a fully open-source PWA that suggests you the best time to post on Instagram and also allows you to copy the most popular hashtags just one tap away.

# Why?

I was fed up using other websites and copying hashtags by hand, it's literally painful on a touchscreen. I was bored by calculating timezone offset to get the time when to post.

Also, I value privacy. That's why Rhittm doesn't store anything at all – it has _no backend_. You don't even need to sign-in to use it.

# How?

_One day of work_ with ReactJS. Proudly hosted on Netlify, landing page is on GitHub Pages.

# Details

-  Graph at the top shows Instagram activity. It automatically syncs with your timezone, so the graph is always tuned up just for you.
-  There are hashtag categories. You can pick as many as you want, and Rhittm will generate thirty random hashtags of that categories. Tap them to copy instantly.
-  Cat at the top is always looking at you. It uses your accelerometer.

# I want this!
