When I was asked to write a code of conduct for the first time, I really thought it was easy.

I was wrong.

So, being a programmer, I created [The Code of Conduct Generator](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/the-code-of-conduct-generator), so everyone could generate one themselves.

It's really easy: you just type in your community or company name, the reporting email and check some checkboxes. Boom, you're good to go.

# Facts

-  **Time spent on the whole project:** two hours
-  **Time spent fiddling around with that button gradient and box-shadow:** almost one hour
-  **Food eaten during creating this:** one Big Mac with bacon

Be kind to others.
